LeapExperiments
===============

Messing around with the Leap Motion controller.

You can find all demos in the <b>Demos</b> folder.

<p><b>LeapCinderVectorField.exe</b> - Just wave your fingers over the leap motion controller.  The arrows should point to the closest finger.</p>
<p><b>LeapFishy.exe</b> - Swipe to move the fish around.  Right now you can only consume fishes smaller than you.  More game functionality later.</p>
<p><b>LeapCinderRain.exe</b> - Right now the rain just bounces off your fingers back into the sky.  This is a WIP.</p>

The projects are done using the Leap SDK and Cinder

<p><b>Leap Motion:</b> https://www.leapmotion.com/</p>
<p><b>Cinder:</b> http://libcinder.org/</p>

The source for each of the executables can be found in their respective folder.  The visual studio solution will likely not compile though.  You only need to include the default Cinder and Leap SDKs to the VS project and they should compile.
