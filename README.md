LeapExperiments
===============

Messing around with the Leap Motion controller.

<b>LeapCinderVectorField.exe</b> - Just wave your fingers over the leap motion controller.  The arrows should point to the closest finger.

The projects are done using the Leap SDK and Cinder

<p><b>Leap Motion:</b> https://www.leapmotion.com/</p>
<p><b>Cinder:</b> http://libcinder.org/</p>

I believe the source will not compile through the solution because it is currently pointing to LeapSDK and Cinder libraries that are not on this repository.  I will fix that later.
